    <h1>Observations:</h1>
    <p>
        1.  After entering two students information into the database, I observerd 2 HTTP requests. One request being "main.js" and the other is jquery-3.1.1.min.js 
    </p>
    <p>
        2. The action associated with adding a student record is clicking the "Add Record" button. 
        When the button is clicked, the textfield beneath changes to conformation of the student being added to the database.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Each communicaiton uses an HTTP get request. 
        By clicking the "Add record" button, we are effectivly sending the information to the server 
        to be entered into the student database to be displayed in the status field or updated student list. 
    </p>
